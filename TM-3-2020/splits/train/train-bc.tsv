<U>Yes, that was a great movie. It had suspense, action and comedy. Great acting talent as well. That makes me excited for Terminator Dark Fate as well. Are any of the original cast back?<C><U>I really enjoy a movie full of suspense and good character development. I have heard mixed reviews of the Joker, Gemini Man and Countdown.

I have seen that mental health is a big focus in Joker.<U>I like to feel like I’m a part of the movie and get to see inside the minds of the characters. That is one reason I want to see Joker.

I will look into Terminator as well.<U>I really don’t enjoy the typical comic book based movie so I’m glad to hear cinematography is good in Joker.<A>Gemini man has an interesting duality question at its core.

Terminator and IT Chapter 2 are of that variety.<U>Conflict with ones self has always interested me and the special effects must be amazing! I am not usually a fan of reboots unless original directors are at the helm. Is that the case with Terminator?<A>No this film is directed by relative new comer Tim Miller.
